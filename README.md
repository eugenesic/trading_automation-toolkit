\# Trading Automation Toolkit 🐍💹



Real-world Python scripts I write every single day on my 3-year journey from zero to OpenAI-level engineer.  

All projects are focused on algo-trading \& quantitative finance.



Current progress: Day 1 → learning Python basics the right way



\### Day 1 – Python Basics (Automate the Boring Stuff Ch. 0-6)

\- Variables, data types, operators

\- Flow control (if/else, loops)

\- Functions

\- Lists, dictionaries, strings



More scripts every day. Follow the journey.
