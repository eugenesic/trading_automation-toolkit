TRADING AUTOMATION TOOLKIT
Learning Roadmap & Vision

This is a zero-to-expert journey in software engineering, quantitative finance, and systems design — built entirely in public.
No prior experience. No shortcuts. Just daily progress, one commit at a time.

GOAL:
Go from "Hello World" to hired as a software engineer or quant researcher at top-tier firms like:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Jane Street
- Citadel Securities
- HRT, Two Sigma, Jump Trading

All through self-education, open-source projects, and relentless practice.

LEARNING PATH: From Zero to World-Class

PHASE 1: Learn to Code (Days 1–30)
- Variables, loops, functions, conditionals
- Data structures: lists, dicts, strings, JSON
- Automate real tasks: watchlists, PnL, signals
- Write clean, readable code with comments
- Master Git and GitHub (commits, branches, .gitignore)

Goal: Be comfortable writing small tools in Python.

PHASE 2: Data & Backtesting (Days 31–90)
- Work with real financial data (OHLCV, 1-minute bars)
- Store data efficiently (Parquet, CSV, databases)
- Build a correct backtester (avoid lookahead, fees, slippage)
- Calculate key metrics: CAGR, Sharpe, max drawdown
- Test strategies on BTC, ETH, and altcoins

Goal: Understand how trading strategies are tested — and why most fail.

PHASE 3: Systems & Engineering (Days 91–180)
- Modular code: split into functions and files
- Add logging, error handling, config files
- Use type hints and write unit tests
- Optimize performance (vectorization, memory)
- Set up CI/CD: test on every commit

Goal: Write code that looks like it belongs in a real firm.

PHASE 4: Math & Finance (Days 181–365)
- Statistics: mean, variance, correlation, p-values
- Time series: trends, volatility, stationarity
- Risk management: position size, stop-loss, Kelly criterion
- Portfolio math: diversification, Sharpe ratio
- Backtest validation: walk-forward, Monte Carlo

Goal: Think like a quant — use data and logic, not guesses.

PHASE 5: Advanced Topics (Days 366–720)
- Machine learning: sklearn, PyTorch, forecasting
- NLP: analyze news, social media, filings
- Reinforcement learning (careful: easy to overfit)
- Low-latency systems: C++, Rust, async code
- Order book dynamics and market microstructure

Goal: Compete with research-level codebases.

PHASE 6: Real Systems & Hiring (Days 721–1080)
- Connect to exchange APIs (Binance, Bybit)
- Run paper trading 24/7 with monitoring
- Deploy on cloud (Docker, AWS, cron jobs)
- Build project portfolio
- Practice coding interviews (LeetCode, system design)
- Apply to top companies — and get offers

Goal: Land a job solving hard technical problems at scale.

WHY THIS WORKS

This is not about getting rich from trading.
It’s about using trading as a training ground to master:

- Software engineering
- Data handling
- Math and statistics
- Independent learning
- Problem-solving under uncertainty

These are the exact skills that OpenAI, Jane Street, and Citadel look for — just applied to a real-world domain.

FINAL NOTE

This repo is my coding dojo.
I don’t know everything — but I commit to learning every day.

If you're also building from zero to expert:
- Star the repo
- Watch the progress
- Build your own path

The only rule?
Show up. Every day.
